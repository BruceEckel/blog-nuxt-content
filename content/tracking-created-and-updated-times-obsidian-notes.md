![obsidian note property data](https://cln.sh/pr21SYgj+)

The community plugin [update-time-on-edit](https://github.com/beaussan/update-time-on-edit-obsidian) auto-generates the `created_at` and `last_modified` properties (front-matter) in my notes.

On note creation, the two properties are created. Then, additional edits to the file will modify the `last_modified` property.

The settings are extensive and provide just about anything I could ask for.

Thanks to [this obsidian forum post by richardOracleDba](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/tracking-when-a-note-was-created-and-last-edited/44059/14) for recommending it.
