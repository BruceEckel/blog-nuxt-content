[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a modern approach to the classic flash cards. Where it excels is in the use of [spaced repitition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

Rather than take a deck of cards and studying it from top to bottom, Anki provides a way to surface cards are the correct time right as it's about to leave your memory bank. 

This has proven to be a very powerful form of studying, and is becoming increasingly popular in fields like medicine and language where memorization is essential.
