My wife and I watch a decent amount of movies every year. We always have good conversations about them but we've never captured these conversations before now.

I hope to capture some of our conversations, ratings, and other miscellaneous thoughts in this document.

## 2025

### [Nosferatu](https://www.imdb.com/es/title/tt5040012/)

- Watched: January 1st
- Rating: 6.5

Nothing special. It's an entertaining movie, but doesn't hit home on anything noteworthy. It's not scary, thought provoking, or visually appealing.

I recommend passing on this film or waiting for it to come out on streaming services.
