The seats used for the table and guest-bed area are falling apart. The inside cushion is fine, so I'm going to take measurements of the cushion components and replace the outside shells.

I need to see what is available and their pricing. But my initial that is that I will make

I'm going for a shape similar to a pillow case. With the ability to easily remove the outer layer and wash it.
