1956 T Bird
Grandpa bought it in 1961
Passed down to my dad when grandfather died in 1972
Dad used it all throughout his teenage years and a good chunk of his life
Got so warn out so my dad tore it down to rebuild it around 20 years ago but now that he's retired, he cannot afford to bring it back together.
