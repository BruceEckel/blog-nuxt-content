## Tell me about yourself / Something Interesting not in CV

I'm a strong believer in the "Learning in Public" philosophy. I love to learn and I love to help others learn what I've learned.

Every time I learn something that requires a decent amount of effort, I make an attempt to share what I learned on my blog, Youtube, or micro-blogging sites. I want others to be able to find the solution to their problem quicker than I did. I believe that sharing my journey creates value both for myself and others. It reflects the idea that learning is a collective, rather than solitary, activity.

## Why Amazon?

Amazon, and in particular AWS, consistently produces some of the highest quality content and tooling in the developer space. I resonate deeply with the Amazon Leadership Principles and want to collaborate with the best minds, learn from them, and support the growth of the Generative AI sector in becoming a leader in this revolutionary space.

## What is your favorite Leadership Principle (LP)?

- Learn and be curious - This is a LP that resonates with me deeply. Every action I take and conversation I have strives to accomplish this. I am constantly on the look out for learning opportunities.
- Customer Obsession - I hope to someday share everything I know with others so that they may take from me what they want and hopefully better themselves. I want others to be able to learn from my mistakes as well as find inspiration in my achievements.

## Customer Obsession

> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

- When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?

[[#Costream]]

- Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?

[[#Great Wall of China]]

- Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone

[[#RV stuck in wilderness with friends]]

- Who was your most difficult customer?

[[#Boot fitting]]

- Can you tell me about a time you obsessed over giving very high quality service to a customer?

[[#i18nLocale]]
[[#Voluntarily lead front-end web interviews]]

## Ownership

> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

- Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult short term decision to make long term gains.

[[#NREL testing compromise]]
[[#Year off]]

- Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.

[[#FIFA+ testing strategy]]

[[#Nuxt Nation tRPC]]
[[#Voluntarily lead front-end web interviews]]

- Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.

- Biggest career failure - What have you learned?

[[#Year off]]

## Invent and simplify

> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

- Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.

[[#Blog re-build]]

- Tell me about a time when you changed a process at work through either an innovative new way or simplification.

[[#Project status automation]]

## Leaders are right a lot

> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

- Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

[[#Lolesports undocumented API]]

- Tell me about a time when you incorporated a diverse set of perspectives into solving a problem.

[[#Mapping hot springs]]

- Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team member’s approach.

[[#NREL testing compromise]]

- Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team member’s approach.

[[#Reduced learning scope]]

## Learn and be curious

>Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

- Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.

[[#Mapping hot springs]]
[[#RV stuck in wilderness with friends]]

- A time when I disproved something I believed

[[#Year off]]

## Hire and develop the best

> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

- Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.

[[#China swim teaching]]

- How you help your team members develop their careers

[[#China swim teaching]]
[[#Reduced learning scope]]

- A time when you provided feedback to develop & leverage the strengths of someone on your team.

[[#Reduced learning scope]]
## Insist on the highest standards

> Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

- Tell me about a time when a team member didn’t meet your expectations on a project.

[[#Reduced learning scope]]

- Tell me a time when you raised the bar

[[#FIFA+ testing strategy]]

## Think Big

> Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

- A time of a radical approach you proposed to solve a big problem

[[#FIFA+ testing strategy]]

- A time when you took a big risk and it failed

[[#Year off]]

## Bias for Action

> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

- Time when I had to make a decision without enough data

[[#Year off]]
## Frugality - More with Less

> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

- A time when you implemented a mechanism that saved money for your business

[[#FIFA+ testing strategy]]

- A time when you spotted something in the business was wasting money

## Earn trust

> Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

- A time you significantly contributed to improving morale and productivity on your team

Presentation in front of company?

- 3 things you’re working on to improve overall effectiveness
- A time you received tough or critical feedback

[[#Critique → Obsidian]]

## Dive deep

> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

- A time you were trying to understand a problem on your team and had to go down several layers to figure it out

[[#NREL testing compromise]]

- A time you linked two or more problems together and identified an underlying issue
- A specific metric you have used to identify a need for a change in your department
## Have a backbone, disagree and commit

> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

- A time you strongly disagreed with your manager

[[#NREL testing compromise]]

- A time you took an unpopular stance in a meeting with peers/leaders

[[#NREL testing compromise]]

- A time you decided to go along with the group decision even if you disagreed

- A time when you disagreed, spoke your thoughts, but then agreed to commit even if it wasn’t the way you wanted to go

## Deliver results

> Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

- A time you were driving toward a goal and realized more than half way in that it may not be the best goal

[[#Year off]]

- A goal you set that took a long time to achieve/are still working towards

[[#Year off]]

- A time you delivered a project under a tight deadline

[[#NREL testing compromise]]
## Be the earth’s best employer

> Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

- How you help your team members develop their careers

[[#China swim teaching]]

- A time when you provided feedback to develop & leverage the strengths of someone on your team.

[[#Reduced learning scope]]

## Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

> We started in a garage, but we’re not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.

- Tell me about a time when you made a decision which impacted the team or the company.

[[#FIFA+ testing strategy]]

- Tell me about a decision that you made about your work and you regret now.

[[#Year off]]

- Tell me about a time when you failed to do the right thing.

## Stories

> Individual stories that I can bring up when questioned.

### Costream

S: I built a web application for e-sports and co-stream viewers. It became very popular in the Twitch community. The web app was built to be flexible and work with many games, but I was struggling to monetize it.

T: The majority of users used it to watch League of Legend e-sports. So, I decided to focus in on the League of Legends user base and specialize the site for them, with premium features that could enhance the League of Legends viewership experience.

A: I focussed my development on features specific to League of Legends. Building features such as the real-time in game stats panel.

R: User's loved it. But shortly after deploying my release, the official League of Legends Twitch account provided a similar experience directly within the Twitch application as well as removing co-streamer restrictions killing the desire to utilize my site.

### Great Wall of China

**S:** While working in China, I led a multi-day backpacking trip along the Great Wall of China as part of the Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award program. The goal was to provide my students with an experiential learning opportunity, encouraging them to step out of their comfort zones and develop resilience and self-reliance.

**T:** At the end of the trip, one of the accompanying teachers shared constructive feedback with me. They pointed out that several students were struggling to navigate steep, gravel-covered slopes safely. The teacher asked why I hadn’t taken the opportunity to teach the students proper techniques for walking on uneven terrain, something that I, with my outdoor experience, had taken for granted.

**A:** Upon reflection, I realized that what comes naturally to me may not be intuitive for others, especially students with less outdoor experience. To address this, I made it a point in future trips to proactively identify teachable moments and share practical skills before engaging in activities. For example, I began demonstrating techniques for walking safely on different terrains, ensuring students felt more confident and prepared.

**R:** This experience enhanced my self-awareness as a leader and educator. I became more attentive to my students’ needs and learned to balance letting them explore independently with providing the necessary guidance. As a result, my students were better equipped to handle challenges, and I became more effective at facilitating their learning and growth.

### RV stuck in wilderness with friends

**S**: A few months ago, my wife, a friend, and I went camping in my vintage RV near a remote hot spring in the California mountains. When it was time to leave, the RV wouldn't start, and I felt responsible for putting them in a tough spot since I had chosen the location.

**T**: The RV was far off the beaten path, so towing it would have been very challenging. Staying overnight wasn’t an option, as my friend had work, I had an important interview the next day, and a snow storm was on its way. We needed to either fix the RV or find alternative solutions.

**A**: I apologized to my wife and friend for the situation and assured them I would do everything possible to resolve it quickly. Then, I took a systematic troubleshooting approach, checking each potential failure point of the vehicle. First, I checked and jump-started the battery, but the engine still wouldn’t start. Next, I ensured the fuel pump was functioning and added gasoline, as the gauge was unreliable. Lastly, I confirmed the engine was getting a spark.

**R**: After these steps, the RV finally started with a combination of the jump start and adding gasoline. We were able to leave safely and make it to our destinations on time.

### What is your superpower?

My superpower is my ability to embrace the unknown and thrive in unconventional environments. I strive to live an exotic life, constantly seeking out the road less traveled. Whether it's exploring unfamiliar challenges or venturing into areas that others might find too uncomfortable, I actively seek out opportunities to grow and learn.

This mindset not only broadens my personal perspective but also equips me to bring fresh, innovative ideas to the table. I believe that by sharing my unique experiences and insights, I empower others with additional information and perspectives they can use to make more informed decisions.

On teams, this superpower often translates into identifying creative solutions, tackling challenges from angles others might not consider, and fostering a culture of open-mindedness. My ability to adapt and provide value in uncharted territory is a strength I consistently leverage to help teams achieve their goals.

### Boot fitting

S: When I was working at the ski resort in Crested Butte, CO I was in charge of putting the ski boots on the customers. Customers would request a boot size that was larger than I would recommend the reason being in previous experiences they would have foot pain while skiing.

T: I needed to educate the customer that they're foot pain was because their ski boot was too big not because the boot is to tight, when the boot is too large it moves a lot and it causes banging around which causes pain.

A: I would educate them on where does foot pain comes when skiing, and try my best to convince them to try to use a different size of boot. The costumer is always welcome to try any size shoe they wanted so if they decided the small shoe was uncomfortable they could come in and try a new size, but I would encourage them to try my guidance and expertise.

R: Almost always customers would use the properly size boot through out the day and would return smiling and excited to tell me how the boot work. :)

### i18nLocale

S: I built a web application using a new tool called Transformer JS which allows you to run local AI models in your browser. The goal of the application was to enable developers to translate their i18n files. I was able to create an mvp within a day.

T:  I intentionally gave myself a month to finish the product to give me time to find tune and polish it.

A: I spend the remainder of my time creating user experience and user interface flows that I was proud of.

R: I got a lot of comments from users, they were very impressed by the site and they still use it to this day.

### NREL testing compromise

S: I lead a team that was building an app for a government organization, we were on a greenfield project that included using their new enterprise Github infrastructure. We were the first team in their organization to move to this platform. There ended up being strict firewall rules were in place that prevented us from running certain tests in our CI/CD pipeline.

T: Our task was to maintain a strong tested application given the constraints while the infrastructure team figured out how to adjust our firewalls setting to run our tests, which would take months and we only had week to launch this website.

A: We organized our tests in a way were we can maintain max testability in our CI/CD pipeline and created a system that allowed us to run the remaining test in our local environment.

R: We were able to hit our deadlines while maintaining a quality product.

### FIFA+ testing strategy

**S:** I joined a team late in a project where responsibilities were unclear, and no major features or deadlines were defined. I wasn’t given explicit direction but wanted to make a meaningful contribution.

**T:** I decided to analyze the codebase to identify areas where I could provide the most impact.

**A:** I began by examining the tests, using them to map implemented features and assess the project's resilience. I discovered that the frontend had no testing coverage, which posed a risk to stability. I proposed and implemented a comprehensive testing plan for our frontend web application. This included introducing Playwright for end-to-end tests, Testing Library and React Testing Library for integration tests, Jest for unit tests, and MSW.js to mock and test UI error states.

**R:** My work significantly improved the team's confidence in the application's stability. It streamlined debugging, reduced regressions, and enhanced our ability to simulate and address edge cases. The team was thrilled, as these changes not only improved quality but also fostered a more resilient development process.

### Nuxt Nation tRPC

**S:** I recognized the importance of contributing to programming communities and showcasing my expertise, so I pursued the opportunity to give a conference talk at Nuxt Nation on the topic of end-to-end type safety using tRPC. This topic was both highly relevant to developers and an area I was personally eager to explore further.

**T:** My goal was to create an engaging and well-researched presentation while managing my full-time job responsibilities. This required balancing rigorous preparation with my day-to-day work, as I had limited prior experience with the subject.

**A:** I approached this by setting clear weekly goals to research the topic, outline the presentation, and develop a polished talk. To ensure depth and accuracy, I sought feedback from peers and actively practiced presenting to improve clarity and delivery. I also structured my learning to make it manageable alongside work, dedicating specific evenings to preparation.

**R:** The talk was well-received, with attendees expressing appreciation for the topic's relevance and clarity. As a result, I was invited to present the same talk at another event a few months later, which significantly expanded my professional network and reinforced my skills in public speaking and technical education.

### Voluntarily lead front-end web interviews

**S:** In my previous role, I voluntarily joined the recruitment process because I was passionate about ensuring candidates had a positive experience, particularly for JavaScript and TypeScript roles. I believed that the interview process should not only evaluate skills but also reflect the company's values and culture.

**T:** My goal was to design and lead the technical interview process, creating questions that were both challenging and adaptable to candidates' skill levels. I wanted each candidate to feel respected and to walk away with a positive impression of our company.

**A:** I invested significant time researching and developing creative technical problems that mirrored real-world scenarios. After each interview, I gathered feedback from the candidates and my colleagues to refine and improve the process. I also ensured the interviews were conversational and constructive, providing candidates with the opportunity to showcase their strengths in a comfortable setting.

**R:** This effort resulted in hiring several exceptional developers, two of whom became key contributors to our TypeScript projects and were recognized as top performers within the company. Feedback from candidates highlighted the interview process as one of the reasons they chose to join our team, reinforcing the importance of the high-quality service I provided.

### Year off

S: I decided to take a year off work to pursue a personal side project aimed at generating passive income. My goal was to build a series of applications that could provide long-term financial returns.

T: I set out to develop and launch these applications independently, believing that with enough time and effort, I could create something successful. My plan was ambitious, and I was determined to see it through.

A: I poured all my time and energy into the project, working tirelessly on the applications. However, I underestimated the toll this would take on my mental health and motivation. Without setting clear milestones or seeking external input, I quickly became overwhelmed. When the initial results fell short of my expectations, I experienced burnout and stagnation. Instead of reassessing my approach, I withdrew and avoided the work altogether, which compounded the problem.

R: Ultimately, the project didn’t achieve the success I envisioned, but it became one of my greatest learning experiences. I learned three key lessons:

1. Acts of creation, whether coding or writing, require balance and intentional rest to avoid burnout.
2. Setting realistic, incremental goals is crucial, as overly ambitious plans can backfire.
3. Collaboration and seeking feedback are essential. Isolating myself meant missing out on valuable insights and motivation from others.

Today, I apply these lessons to all my work. I prioritize sustainable effort, embrace collaboration, and allow myself the flexibility to learn and iterate. This approach has made me more effective, resilient, and balanced in my career.

### Blog re-build

S: I manage a personal blog where I regularly publish my writing. Initially, I used Vitepress, a documentation library often used for Vite and Vue-related projects. While it worked well at first, it became increasingly complex as I customized it to suit my blogging needs.

T: I needed a simpler, more flexible solution that would streamline my blogging process, reduce complexity, and allow me to write and publish from any device.

A: After researching alternatives, I decided to rebuild my blog using Nuxt.js and Nuxt Content. This framework allowed me to easily migrate my existing markdown files while providing a flexible platform for customization. To further simplify my workflow, I integrated Obsidian, a markdown editor with a robust ecosystem of plugins, as the backbone of my writing process. By setting up a system where I could edit and deploy blog posts directly from Obsidian, I enabled seamless blogging from devices like my phone.

R: The rebuild transformed my blogging experience. What was once a cumbersome process requiring custom scripts and manual intervention became a streamlined and intuitive workflow. Now, I can easily write, edit, and publish from anywhere, which has significantly increased my productivity and made sharing my thoughts much simpler.

### Project status automation

S: A client of mine was curious of the state of the project I was building for her. We would have daily meetings, sometimes twice a day, to give a brief status update. I found these meetings to be distracting at times.

T: I discussed it with the client, and we decided it best to automate some of the status updates.

A: The communication application we used was Discord. I utilized Github's API alongside Discord's to build a Discord bot that send commit and release information to a dedicated channel in our Discord server.

R: My client was very happy with this! She felt comfortable seeing the updates occurring in real-time. This reduced our meeting time significantly, and converted our daily update discussions into a manageable weekly discussion.

### Lolesports undocumented API

S: There's a feature on the League of Legends dedicated e-sports website (Lolesports) that displays match information in real time. Stats such as player gold and build-specializations were viewable there, but no where else.

T: I decided I wanted this information on my co-streaming site that specialized in League of Legends content.

A: The network requests were viewable on their site with the provided API key. It turns out this API does not change and is not user-specific. So, I was able to replicate the API requests on my own site and built the same features that they provided on theirs.

R: Users found this to be very impressive. They had no idea this data existed and were excited to see the site they use provide such a fun and insightful feature.

### Mapping hot springs

S: I was living out of an RV and traveling around the Western states, searching for adventures. I also needed a shower from time to time.

T: Hot springs were the perfect solution. They were fun, plentiful, and typically included an adventure to get to them. They also had the additional benefit of making me feel clean after swimming in them.

A: I met a developer at a hot spring in Utah who was a passionate hot springer. He shared some information with me, including an organized spreadsheet of hot springs throughout the country.

R: This inspired me to research hot spring locations further, where I found a data set provided by [NOAA](https://data.noaa.gov/metaview/page?xml=NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC/Collection/iso/xml/G01139.xml&view=getDataView&header=none). I mapped the data to a web app using Leaflet, providing a nicer way to interface with the hot spring locations. I then used this map to continue traveling around the US and enjoying hot springs every night.

### Reduced learning scope

*I think I can expand on this or branch it off into a separate story where I took on more work than I probably should have in an attempt to allow my team member to have to space to learn what he needed. I tried to protect him, but in the end probably hurt him further do to missed deadlines and eventual burnout from my. I see this as a failure.*

S: I was on a project to build a full-stack web application with another developer. The project was originally scoped to have me on the frontend and the other developer on the backend. My team member wanted to use this project to learn Javascript/Typescript alongside frontend. But, he also decided it was a good time for him to transition to VIM. My team members productivity slowed down dramatically, to a point where we began missing deadlines.

T: I was tasked to have conversations with my team member and find ways to accelerate his productivity while also allowing growth.

A: I originally thought it was okay for him to come into this project with a learning mindset and to soak up as much knowledge as possible. But, given the demands of the client, I reduced his learning scope from Javascript, VIM, and frontend to just Javascript.

R: With a learning focus on only Javascript, it became easier to hit deadlines while also allowing my team member to grow.

### China swim teaching

S: My job in China as an outdoor educator had a pay system that depended on your ability to perform certain activities. The road block for many of our Chinese staff to get a promotion was them lacking the ability to swim.

T: We wanted to help our friends and coworkers progress in their career and learn the incredible skill of swimming. Being from Hawaii, I have swam my entire life and consider myself a strong swimmer.

A: A few friends/coworkers and I decided to hold swimming classes in a river outside of town once a week for anyone that needed it. It became a very popular activity, with many coworkers coming just to hang out and enjoy the river.

R: We leveled up many of our Chinese coworkers so that they were able to pass the swimming at our company had in place. It was a very fun and rewarding experience that has made me some lifelong friends.

### Critique → Obsidian

S: Missing details on tickets

T: No longer wished to miss details

A: Developed a daily journaling habit in Obsidian

R: No longer missed details. Promoted to team lead.


## Interview questions

- Do developer advocates get a monthly budget to use on AI-related research?

  i.e. I'd like to explore Hugging Face Inference Endpoint benchmarks.
	  - Is it cheaper to run a single, cheap machine for my tasks? Should I spawn a single powerful machine and run my code against that? Should I spawn multiple instances of a cheap machine, expensive machine? I'd love to see which of these solutions is the 1. cheapest, 2. fastest, 3. least complex.


## Misc. Tips

"**We** is absolutely appropriate within the S of the STAR method - painting the picture - but afterwards, make sure it's only **I**. Amazon is interviewing me, not my team."

Committed to giving a response within 5 business days of the interview.
