"**We** is absolutely appropriate within the S of the STAR method - painting the picture - but afterwards, make sure it's only **I**. Amazon is interviewing me, not my team."

Committed to giving a response within 5 business days of the interview.

## Tell me about yourself / Something Interesting not in CV

I'm a strong believer in the "Learning in Public" philosophy. I love to learn and I love to help others learn what I've learned.

Every time I learn something that requires a decent amount of effort, I make an attempt to share what I learned on my blog, Youtube, or micro-blogging sites. I want others to be able to find the solution to their problem quicker than I did. I believe that sharing my journey creates value both for myself and others. It reflects the idea that learning is a collective, rather than solitary, activity.

## Why Amazon?

*Why this team?*
- Amazon is SO many different things/businesses within one entity

**Maturity:** Concept of the maturity of the business
There are 3 states of businesses within Amazon:
1. **Build** - brand new sector of Amazon with the task to build something from scratch
2. Scaling - teams and business in place. Business is to scale.
	1. Invent and simplify
3. Optimization - mature, well-established in Amazon. Goal is to optimize to the nth degree and get every piece of value out of it.

*"All about am I raising the bar on the leadership principles. Will I have a long term potential career at Amazon due to growth capabilities."*

Amazon, and in particular AWS, consistently produces some of the highest quality content and tooling in the developer space. I resonate deeply with the Amazon Leadership Principles and want to support the growth of the Gen AI sector in becoming a leader in the space.

## What is your favorite Leadership Principle (LP)?

- Learn and be curious - This is a LP that resonates with me deeply. Every action I take and conversation I have strives to accomplish this. I am constantly on the look out for learning opportunities. 
- Customer Obsession - I hope to someday share everything I know with others so that they may take from me what they want and hopefully better themselves. I want others to be able to learn from my mistakes as well as find inspiration in my achievements.

## What is your superpower?

I live an exotic life. I constantly find myself taking the road less traveled, gaining experience in areas that others may find to be too uncomfortable. I then share this experience with others so that they have more information to base their decisions on.

## Biggest career failure - What have you learned?

I took nearly a year off from work with the intention of building a side project that will generate passive income. It didn't take long before I had burnt myself out building applications that generated no income. I found myself spending tons of time post-burnout finding every reason imaginable to not work on code.

I learned that acts of art and creation cannot be forced. I can't lock myself into a room with a pen and paper and expect a book to suddenly appear.

## A time when I disproved something I believed

## Time when I had to make a decision without enough data

## Customer Obsession

1. When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?

S: I built a web application for e-sports and co-stream viewers. It became very popular in the Twitch community. The web app was built to be flexible and work with many games, but I was struggling to monetize it.

T: The majority of users used it to watch League of Legend e-sports. So, I decided to focus in on the League of Legends user base and specialize the site for them, with premium features that could enhance the League of Legends viewership experience.

A: I focussed my development on features specific to League of Legends. Building features such as the real-time in game stats panel.

R: User's loved it. But shortly after deploying my release, the official League of Legends Twitch account provided a similar experience directly within the Twitch application as well as removing co-streamer restrictions killing the desire to utilize my site.

1. Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?

S: While working in China I did a multi-day backpacking trip along the Great Wall of China. My students were doing it for an award and I took that as an experiential learning, to throw them in the deep-end to see how they do, some of the students struggle and at the end of the trip one of teacher gave me some critique on how I could have done better. The teacher noticed kids were slipping down the gravel hills, and asked me why I didn't teach them how to properly walk down the steps, this came as a surprise, what came to me naturally with experience in the outdoors could be a teachable moment for kids that are not familiar with it. This helped me reflect on things I do naturally that other might not know.

T:  I reflected on the critique and decided to bit a little bit more hands on with future students.

A: I tried to be more attentive to students and apply teach them when given the opportunity. I would teach prior to the activity

R: I gained a better awareness on my leadership skills and the skills of my students when I should step in to teach.

1. Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone

S: My friend, my wife and I were camping in my vintage RV outside of a hot spring in the mountains of California, when it came time to leave our RV would not start. I felt really sorry for bringing my friend and wife here and putting them into a difficult position.

T: We were pretty far from the path so it would be very difficult to get the vehicle towed, staying another night wasn't an option because I have this interview today and my friend had to work, so our only options were to get the car towed somehow or get the car running.

A: I took a systematic approach and decided to go down the list of what could be possible broken, so first we checked the battery and got it jumped start, and the car still didn't start, then we added gasoline and verify that the fuel pump and fuel system was working, and then we verified that the vehicle had spark.

R: It turns out it required a jump start and adding gasoline to get the motor running and we were able to get out find and make it to our destination.


1. Who was your most difficult customer?

S: When I was working at the ski resort in Crested Butte, CO I was in charge of putting the ski boots on the customers. Customers would request a boot size that was larger than I would recommend the reason being in previous experiences they would have foot pain while skiing.

T: I needed to educate the customer that they're foot pain was because their ski boot was too big not because the boot is to tight, when the boot is too large it moves a lot and it causes banging around which causes pain.

A: I would educate them on where does foot pain comes when skiing, and try my best to convince them to try to use a different size of boot. The costumer is always welcome to try any size shoe they wanted so if they decided the small shoe was uncomfortable they could come in and try a new size, but I would encourage them to try my guidance and expertise.

R: Almost always customers would use the properly size boot through out the day and would return smiling and excited to tell me how the boot work. :)

3. Can you tell me about a time you obsessed over giving very high quality service to a customer?

S: I built a web application using a new tool called Transformer JS which allows you to run local AI models in your browser. The goal of the application was to enable developers to translate their i18n files. I was able to create an mvp within a day.

T:  I intentionally gave myself a month to finish the product to give me time to find tune and polish it.

A: I spend the remainder of my time creating user experience and user interface flows that I was proud of.

R: I got a lot of comments from users, they were very impressed by the site and they still use it to this day.

## Ownership

1. Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult short term decision to make long term gains.

S: I lead a team that was building an app for a government organization, we were on a greenfield project that included using their new enterprise Github infrastructure. We were the first team in their organization to move to this platform. There ended up being strict firewall rules were in place that prevented us from running certain tests in our CI/CD pipeline.

T: Our task was to maintain a strong tested application given the constraints while the infrastructure team figured out how to adjust our firewalls setting to run our tests, which would take months and we only had week to launch this website.

A: We organized our tests in a way were we can maintain max testability in our ci/cd pipeline and created a system that allowed us to run the remaining test in our local envioerment.

R: We were able to hit our deadlines while maintaining a quality product.

1. Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.

S: I joined a team late in the project's life span, this project had no deadlines or major features to develop. I wasn't given any explicit direction.

T: I decided to understand the code base and find the pieces that I ambuseded (emvest) to work on as well as most likely to make a positive impact.

A: I started with the tests, I used the tests as a way to map the features that were implemented in a resilient and effective way. I was surprised to find that none of the front end was tested, so I took it upon my self to make a testing plan for our front end web application.

R: I brought in tools such as play right, and e2e framer work, testing library, react testing library for integration tests and jest for unit tests. I also brought in msw JS to mock end test different UI error states. The team was thrilled and found this work to be beneficial.

3. Tell me about a time when you took it upon yourself to work on a challenging initiative.

S: I wanted to get further involved with programing communities that I could interact with so i decided to give a conference talk at Nuxt Nation about end-to-end type safety using TRPC.

T: I had to come up with and prepared a talk for this conference while maintaining my full time job responsabilities.

A: I would dedicate a set amount of hours per week to research and better understand the topic that I was going to give the talk about, which I was not very familiarized with but I knew people would find it interesting, and also to incentivize myself to learn because it was also a topic I was interested in learning.

R: The audience was very happy about the topic  and I was actually invited to do the same talk a few months later.

5. Tell me about a time when you took on a task that went beyond your normal responsibilities.

S: I got very involved with recruitment in my previous company helping with the interview process for new candidates. It was completley voluntary and something i requested to be a part of to help.

T:  I lead the type-script and javascript interviews processs coming up with creative and technical questions that had to be flexible and match the candidate skills.

A: I interviewed several prospected candidates and learn from each interview for future candidated so they would be givien and enjoyable interview experience.

R: Succesfully brought on a few developers that became the companies best type script developers.

## Invent and simplify

1. Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.

S: I regularly write and publish my writing on my personal blog. My original blog utilized a documentation library called Vitepress which is what most Vite and Vue-related packages use. It worked well initially, but became increasingly complex as I tried to make it fit my blogging needs.

T: I decided it was time to re-build my blog using Nuxt.js and their blogging/documentation library Nuxt Content. This let me easily migrate the markdown files I used for my previous blog but gave me a blank canvas that I could build out to perfectly fit my needs.

A: A key part of this re-build required the use of Obsidian to be the backbone of my writing. It's a markdown editor that has a thriving ecosystem of plugins and tools that make my life easier. I needed my blog to be able to be edited and deployed from Obsidian because it then allowed me to blog from any device, including my cellphone.

R: The original blog that I had used became increasingly complex and difficult to work with. It had many custom build scripts and processes that overtime bogged down my ability to share my thoughts on the web. It took me awhile to commit to a re-build, but it ended up being very simple and simplified my entire blogging process, allowing me to share my thoughts from any device.

1. Tell me about a time when you changed a process at work through either an innovative new way or simplification.

S: A client of mine was curious of the state of the project I was building for her. We would have daily meetings, sometimes twice a day, to give a brief status update. I found these meetings to be distracting at times.

T: I discussed it with the client, and we decided it best to automate some of the status updates.

A: The communication application we used was Discord. I utilized Github's API alongside Discord's to build a Discord bot that send commit and release information to a dedicated channel in our Discord server.

R: My client was very happy with this! She felt comfortable seeing the updates occurring in real-time. This reduced our meeting time significantly, and converted our daily update discussions into a manageable weekly discussion.

## Are right a lot

1. Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

S: There's a feature on the League of Legends dedicated e-sports website (Lolesports) that displays match information in real time. Stats such as player gold and build-specializations were viewable there, but no where else.

T: I decided I wanted this information on my co-streaming site that specialized in League of Legends content.

A: The network requests were viewable on their site with the provided API key. It turns out this API does not change and is not user-specific. So, I was able to replicate the API requests on my own site and built the same features that they provided on theirs.

R: Users found this to be very impressive. They had no idea this data existed and were excited to see the site they use provide such a fun and insightful feature.

1. Tell me about a time when you incorporated a diverse set of perspectives into solving a problem.

S: I was living out of an RV and traveling around the Western states, searching for adventures. I also needed a shower from time to time.

T: Hot springs were the perfect solution. They were fun, plentiful, and typically included an adventure to get to them. They also had the additional benefit of making me feel clean after swimming in them.

A: I met a developer at a hot spring in Utah who was a passionate hot springer. He shared some information with me, including an organized spreadsheet of hot springs throughout the country.

R: This inspired me to research hot spring locations further, where I found a data set provided by [NOAA](https://data.noaa.gov/metaview/page?xml=NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC/Collection/iso/xml/G01139.xml&view=getDataView&header=none). I mapped the data to a web app using Leaflet, providing a nicer way to interface with the hot spring locations. I then used this map to continue traveling around the US and enjoying hot springs every night.

1. Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team member’s approach.

We encountered dependency issues in our build system due to a firewall rule in the companies Enterprise version of Github Actions, breaking a significant number of automated tests. It would take potentially months to get a security audit on the dependency we required.

My team wanted to move to a purely-manual testing strategy - running our tests manually prior to committing the code. I struggled to feel confident in this and explored other options.

While I was unable to find a solution to the specific dependency issue, I was able to isolate the tests that were impacted by the issue, allowing the remaining viable tests to be ran in our CI pipeline.

3. Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team member’s approach.

S: I was on a project to build a full-stack web application with another developer. The project was originally scoped to have me on the frontend and the other developer on the backend. My team member wanted to use this project to learn Javascript/Typescript alongside frontend. But, he also decided it was a good time for him to transition to VIM. My team members productivity slowed down dramatically, to a point where we began missing deadlines.

T: I was tasked to have conversations with my team member and find ways to accelerate his productivity while also allowing growth.

A: I originally thought it was okay for him to come into this project with a learning mindset and to soak up as much knowledge as possible. But, given the demands of the client, I reduced his learning scope from Javascript, VIM, and frontend to just Javascript.

R: With a learning focus on only Javascript, it became easier to hit deadlines while also allowing my team member to grow.

## Learn and be curious

1. Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.

## Hire and develop the best

1. Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.

S: My job in China as an outdoor educator had a pay system that depended on your ability to perform certain activities. The road block for many of our Chinese staff to get a promotion was them lacking the ability to swim.

T: We wanted to help our friends and coworkers progress in their career and learn the incredible skill of swimming. Being from Hawaii, I have swam my entire life and consider myself a strong swimmer.

A: A few friends/coworkers and I decided to hold swimming classes in a river outside of town once a week for anyone that needed it. It became a very popular activity, with many coworkers coming just to hang out and enjoy the river.

R: We leveled up many of our Chinese coworkers so that they were able to pass the swimming at our company had in place. It was a very fun and rewarding experience that has made me some lifelong friends.

## Insist on the highest standards

1. Tell me about a time when a team member didn’t meet your expectations on a project.

*"They are asking about my behavior, not my accomplishment."* 
- Philosophy
- Process
- Outcome

I lead a greenfield project that was built by me and another developer. This developer was a mid-senior level developer with little Javascript experience, specializing in C++ and backend development. 

He came into the project with the goal of learning frontend web development, Typescript, and VIM.

It quickly became obvious he took on too many learning opportunities at once.

I decided it was best to reduce his learning goals a bit, focussing first on Javascript/Typescript on the backend. As his confidence grew with the language, I began passing him frontend tickets and mentoring him as needed.

Eventually I was able to feel confident in assigning him tickets within any part of the stack.

## Most successful project?

Costream

## Most innovative project?

i18nLocale

## Highest impact project?

NREL

## Most proud of project?

## Interview questions

- Do developer advocates get a monthly budget to use on AI-related research?

  i.e. I'd like to explore Hugging Face Inference Endpoint benchmarks.
	  - Is it cheaper to run a single, cheap machine for my tasks? Should I spawn a single powerful machine and run my code against that? Should I spawn multiple instances of a cheap machine, expensive machine? I'd love to see which of these solutions is the 1. cheapest, 2. fastest, 3. least complex.
