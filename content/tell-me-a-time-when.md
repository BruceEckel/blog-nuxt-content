## Customer Obsession

1. When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?

S: I built a web application for e-sports and co-stream viewers. It became very popular in the Twitch community. The web app was built to be flexible and work with many games, but I was struggling to monetize it. 

T: The majority of users used it to watch League of Legend e-sports. So, I decided to focus in on the League of Legends user base and specialize the site for them, with premium features that could enhance the League of Legends viewership experience.

A: I focussed my development on features specific to League of Legends. Building features such as the real-time in game stats panel.

R: User's loved it. But shortly after deploying my release, the official League of Legends Twitch account provided a similar experience directly within the Twitch application as well as removing co-streamer restrictions killing the desire to utilize my site.
