## Stack

> This solution probably works with your device, I'm just sharing the explicit details of what I have.

- iPhone 13 Pro Max
- iOS v18.1
- Obsidian v1.7.5.


## Step-by-step

> I tried many of the options listed online, but after hours of work, only the steps I'm sharing ended up working.

1. Install & open Obsidian
2. Create new vault (a random name should do, we'll delete this later)
3. Go to Files -> On my iPhone -> Obsidian 
4. Copy your existing vault to the Obsidian folder
5. Delete the new vault you created
