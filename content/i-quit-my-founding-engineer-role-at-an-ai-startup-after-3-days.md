These last few weeks have been a bit hectic for me.

This document is a place for me to put my thoughts down for my future self and hopefully others to get value out of.

## Finding the position

I tend to be a bit of a lurker on Hackernews and only reach out to users that post on the Who's hiring threads. I've had ~~little~~ no luck from these threads.

So, I posted in the Hackernews Who wants to be hired (January 2025) thread for the first time in my career.

This brought a surprising amount of people to me. Around five companies reached out, and I interviewed with three of them. All three of the companies were "AI" startups. 

I put AI in quotes because one of them had a basic chat bot implementation and used it as a marketing tool to say they have AI integrated products. The other two were proper AI companies. One is attempting to build the best OCR product on the market. The other is managing the infrastructure of AI models and giving users an SDK to interact with them.

I was ghosted by two of the companies - both took me through three rounds of interviews before disappearing. The third company sent me an offer after two rounds of interviews.

## The offer

Here's a snippet from the offer I was given for the role:

```
This is what I had in mind and Iâ€™m open to negations:  
- Compensation: USD 100,000/yr  
- Equity: 20,000 shares (4-year vesting) - current value is around ~ USD $300,000
```  

I was a bit surprised with the $100k salary offer. While discussing the role during the interview, I was told the pay band was between $100-150k. Getting offered the minimum of the pay band didn't feel great.

The 20,000 ~~magic beans~~ shares were valued at around $300,00. Maybe that's how he justified the low salary? But even then, in a best-case scenario, it's a $175,000/yr offer, which given the risk, was a low offer to me. If this company took off and I was employee #3, I want to have made a life-changing amount of money. Not an amount that is around the average salary of a FAANG employee.

I asked how much ownership of the company those 20,000 shares gave me. **It was 0.002%**. It seemed low to me. But, I'm new to this and have never worked at a startup before so maybe it's normal at this stage (pre-seed)?

## The negotiation

Funny enough, I think my spam filter played some hardball. The initial offer email as well as a second check-in email were sent to me via their company email. My email provider (gmail) flagged them as spam so I didn't see the email until a few days after the offer.

I finally received the offer when they sent me an email from their personal gmail account.
